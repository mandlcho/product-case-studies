# RedeemSG: Trust Crisis Deep Dive

**Product:** RedeemSG (National Voucher Platform)  
**Major Problem:** Trust erosion from Jan 2025 phishing crisis  
**Analysis Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Analyst:** Mandl Cho

---

## Executive Summary

**The Paradox:**
- ✅ Product works: $1.97B processed, 140M transactions, $288M in Q3 2025 alone
- ❌ Trust broken: 3.1/5 consumer satisfaction (down from policy appreciation)
- ✅ Merchant side thriving: 4.2/5 rating, unaffected by phishing

**The Problem:**
RedeemSG suffered a **security perception crisis** (not a product failure) when scammers created fake redemption sites during Jan 2025 CDC voucher disbursement. Singapore Police Force issued multiple advisories. OGP stayed silent. Consumer trust eroded.

**The Opportunity:**
This isn't a product problem—it's a **communication and positioning problem**. The merchant experience (4.2/5) proves the product works. The consumer side should be repositioned as **policy delivery infrastructure**, not a consumer product.

## Problem Definition

### What Happened: Jan 2025 Phishing Crisis Timeline

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Jan 3, 2025** | CDC voucher disbursement announced | High-value target for scammers |
| **Jan 10-17, 2025** | Fake RedeemSG websites appear | Users receive unsolicited SMS + Instagram posts |
| **Jan 17, 2025** | SPF issues first phishing advisory | Public awareness, but trust already damaged |
| **Jan-Feb 2025** | Multiple SPF advisories continue | Ongoing threat, no OGP counter-messaging |
| **Present** | Consumer satisfaction: 3.1/5 | Trust erosion despite product working |

### The Scam Mechanics

**Attack Vector:**
1. Scammers create counterfeit RedeemSG websites (domain spoofing)
2. Unsolicited SMS messages sent to citizens: "Claim your CDC vouchers now!"
3. Instagram infographics mimicking official government design
4. Fake sites ask for banking credentials + personal details
5. Victims unknowingly hand over sensitive information

**Why It Worked:**
- High-stakes policy moment (CDC vouchers = money)
- Government branding easy to replicate
- Users unfamiliar with official redemption flow
- No proactive education from OGP on "how to spot fakes"

### The Damage

**Quantitative:**
- Consumer satisfaction: **3.1/5** (merchant: 4.2/5)
- 1.1 point gap between merchant and consumer experience
- Multiple SPF advisories = sustained threat perception

**Qualitative:**
- User sentiment: "Appreciate vouchers, but worried about security"
- Reddit/forums: "How do I know if it's the real site?"
- Trust erosion despite core functionality working perfectly

**The Irony:**
RedeemSG's infrastructure handled $288M in Q3 2025 without issues. The product didn't fail—but the brand took damage from external threats.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Trust Eroded (5 Whys)

**1. Why did users lose trust in RedeemSG?**
→ Because they saw multiple police advisories about fake RedeemSG sites.

**2. Why did police advisories damage trust?**
→ Because users couldn't distinguish real from fake sites.

**3. Why couldn't users distinguish real from fake?**
→ Because OGP never proactively educated users on "how to identify the official site."

**4. Why didn't OGP educate users proactively?**
→ Because OGP's response was reactive (waiting for SPF advisories) instead of proactive.

**5. Why was OGP's response reactive?**
→ Because **RedeemSG is positioned as a consumer product** (requiring brand protection) but **treated as policy infrastructure** (no dedicated comms/trust team).

**Root Cause:**
> **Positioning mismatch.** RedeemSG is policy delivery infrastructure (like GoWhere) but marketed as a consumer product. This creates unrealistic expectations for brand protection without the resources to deliver it.

## The Merchant vs Consumer Gap

### Why Merchant Side Works (4.2/5)

| Factor | Merchant Experience | Why It Works |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Use Case** | Scan QR, confirm transaction | Simple, transactional |
| **Relationship** | B2B (training provided) | Onboarding + support |
| **Phishing Exposure** | Low (in-person transactions) | Not vulnerable to fake sites |
| **Expectations** | Tool for business operations | Functional, not emotional |
| **Support** | Dedicated merchant support | Issues resolved quickly |

**User Quote (Merchant):**
> "Works well for accepting vouchers. Occasional network errors on older phones, but overall reliable."

### Why Consumer Side Struggles (3.1/5)

| Factor | Consumer Experience | Why It Struggles |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Use Case** | Claim vouchers, find merchants | Higher stakes (money involved) |
| **Relationship** | B2C (no training) | Self-service, no guidance |
| **Phishing Exposure** | High (SMS scams, fake sites) | Vulnerable to external threats |
| **Expectations** | Secure, trustworthy platform | Emotional (trust required) |
| **Support** | Generic FAQs, no proactive comms | Users feel abandoned |

**User Quote (Consumer):**
> "I appreciate the vouchers, but how do I know if the redemption site is real? Police keep warning about fakes."

### The 1.1 Point Gap Explained

**Merchant side (4.2/5):** Functional tool with B2B support  
**Consumer side (3.1/5):** Trust-dependent platform with no proactive protection

**Insight:**
> The gap isn't about product quality—it's about **trust infrastructure**. Merchants have training and support. Consumers have police advisories and silence from OGP.

## What OGP Did Wrong

### 1. Reactive, Not Proactive

**What Happened:**
- SPF issued advisories (Jan 17, Feb 14)
- OGP stayed silent (no counter-messaging)
- Users left to figure out "real vs fake" on their own

**What Should Have Happened:**
- **Before disbursement:** In-app education: "How to identify the official RedeemSG site"
- **During crisis:** Immediate public statement: "Here's how to stay safe"
- **After crisis:** Trust recovery campaign: "We've got your back"

**User Perception:**
> "The government warns me about fake sites, but RedeemSG doesn't tell me how to stay safe. Are they even aware?"

---

### 2. No Security Education

**What's Missing:**
- In-app onboarding: "How to spot fake redemption sites"
- Visual guide: "Official site vs fake site comparison"
- SMS verification: "We will NEVER ask for banking details"
- Trust signals: "Look for .gov.sg domain"

**Competitor Benchmark:**
- **Banks:** Proactive SMS: "We will never ask for your password"
- **PayPal:** In-app security center with scam examples
- **Grab:** "How to spot fake driver profiles" education

**OGP's Approach:**
- Silence. Let SPF handle it.

**Result:**
- Users associate RedeemSG with phishing risk, not security.

---

### 3. Positioning Confusion

**Current Positioning (Implied):**
- Consumer product (app store presence, branding, user-facing)
- Requires trust, brand protection, user education

**Actual Treatment:**
- Policy infrastructure (no dedicated comms, reactive support)
- Treated like GoWhere (uptime matters, trust doesn't)

**The Mismatch:**
You can't position as a consumer product without investing in consumer trust infrastructure.

**What This Means:**
Either:
- **A) Invest in trust infrastructure** (proactive comms, security education, brand protection)
- **B) Reposition as policy infrastructure** (like GoWhere—success = uptime, not NPS)

**Tactics:**

**1. SMS Verification System**
- Send SMS to all registered users: "Official RedeemSG will NEVER ask for passwords. Bookmark vouchers.gov.sg/redeem"
- Establishes trust baseline

**2. In-App Trust Signals**

- Visual comparison: Real vs fake site screenshots

**3. Merchant Partnership**
- Merchants display: "Redeem safely at vouchers.gov.sg/redeem"
- Physical signage at participating stores
- Leverages merchant trust (4.2/5 rating)

**4. SPF Joint Campaign**
- Co-branded messaging: "SPF + OGP: How to Stay Safe"
- Legitimizes OGP's security efforts
- Shares responsibility for trust recovery

### 90 Days: Reposition Consumer Side

**Strategic Decision:**
Stop treating consumer side as a product. Treat it as **policy delivery infrastructure**.

**What This Means:**

| Current (Product) | Future (Infrastructure) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| App store presence | Embedded in LifeSG/Gov.sg |
| Consumer NPS tracking | Uptime + transaction success rate |
| Brand marketing | Functional communication only |
| User acquisition | Policy-driven (automatic enrollment) |
| Support model | Self-service FAQs | Merchant-focused support |

**Why This Works:**
- Aligns expectations with reality
- Frees resources to focus on merchant experience (4.2/5 → 4.5/5)
- Reduces trust burden (infrastructure doesn't need love, just reliability)

**Precedent:**
- **GoWhere:** 61M visits, 100% uptime, no NPS tracking—success = availability
- **Singpass:** Infrastructure, not product—trust comes from government, not app

**Consumer Experience:**
- Vouchers auto-credited to LifeSG/Gov.sg wallet
- Redemption happens at merchant (QR scan)
- RedeemSG becomes backend infrastructure (invisible to consumer)

**Merchant Experience:**
- Remains front-and-center (4.2/5 → 4.5/5 target)
- Dedicated support, training, feature development
- B2B relationship (sustainable, scalable)

## Key Insights

### 1. The Product Works—Trust Doesn't

**Evidence:**
- $1.97B processed, 140M transactions
- Merchant side: 4.2/5 (unaffected by phishing)
- Consumer side: 3.1/5 (trust crisis)

**Insight:**
> This isn't a product problem. It's a **communication and positioning problem**.

---

### 2. Reactive ≠ Responsible

**What Happened:**
- SPF issued advisories (reactive)
- OGP stayed silent (passive)
- Users felt abandoned

**What Users Needed:**
- Proactive education: "How to stay safe"
- Visible response: "We've got your back"
- Trust signals: "This is the official site"

**Lesson:**
> In a trust crisis, silence = complicity. Users need to see you fighting for them.

---

### 3. Merchant Side Proves the Model

**Why Merchant Works (4.2/5):**
- B2B relationship (training + support)
- Simple use case (scan QR, confirm)
- Low phishing exposure (in-person)

**Opportunity:**
> Double down on merchant experience. Let consumer side be policy infrastructure.

---

### 4. Positioning Mismatch Kills Trust

**The Trap:**
- Positioned as consumer product (app store, branding)
- Treated as policy infrastructure (no trust investment)
- Result: Unrealistic expectations, no resources to meet them

**The Fix:**
> Either invest in consumer trust infrastructure OR reposition as backend infrastructure (like Singpass).

---

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

**The Problem:**
RedeemSG suffered a trust crisis from external phishing threats. OGP's reactive response (silence) made it worse.

**The Opportunity:**
This is fixable. The product works ($1.97B processed). The merchant side thrives (4.2/5). The consumer side just needs trust infrastructure.

**The Recommendation:**

**Short-term (30 days):** Stop the bleeding
- In-app security education
- Public statement: "How to stay safe"
- SMS all users with trust message

**Medium-term (60 days):** Build trust infrastructure
- Visual trust signals (badges, verification)
- Merchant partnership (physical signage)
- SPF joint campaign

**Long-term (90 days):** Reposition as infrastructure
- Embed in LifeSG (invisible to consumer)
- Focus on merchant experience (4.2/5 → 4.5/5)
- Treat consumer side as policy delivery (uptime > NPS)

**The Bet:**
> RedeemSG becomes the **"Stripe for government vouchers"**—invisible infrastructure that just works. Merchants love it. Consumers don't think about it (which is success).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with stakeholders** - Is repositioning as infrastructure feasible?
2. **Prioritize quick wins** - In-app security education (7 days), public statement (7 days)
3. **Make strategic decision** - Consumer product OR infrastructure? Can't be both.

**Timeline:** 7 days for validation, 30 days for quick wins, 90 days for repositioning.
