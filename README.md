# OGP Product Teardowns (private)

Private working repo for full teardowns of **all OGP products**, written from a Product Manager perspective.

## Why private
Drafts can be raw. We’ll promote selected pieces to public repos (e.g. SpendWhat site) when they’re clean and ready.

## Output format (per teardown)
- What it is (1–2 lines)
- Primary users + JTBD
- Product wedge / strategy
- Core workflows
- Metrics (north star + supporting)
- Constraints / risks (gov-specific)
- 30/60/90 day plan
- 3 product-mindset lessons

## Tracker
