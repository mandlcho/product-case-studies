# Mandl Cho — LinkedIn optimization (OGP PM focus, esp. Senior Product Manager (Pair))

Last reviewed: 2026-01-27

## TL;DR
Your current profile reads as a strong **Senior Technical Animator / Animation Systems Engineer**.
To pivot toward **OGP PM (Pair)**, we need to:
1) make your **product intent** unmissable in the first 2 seconds (headline + top card)
2) rewrite experience into **outcomes + stakeholders + roadmap + delivery** language
3) swap Featured from showreels → **product artifacts** (findit, SpendWhat, teardowns)
4) align Skills/keywords to OGP role language (platform, journeys, reliability, metrics)

---

## 1) New headline options (pick 1)

### Option A (cleanest Pair framing)
**Aspiring Product Manager (OGP) | Technical Animation Systems → Product Builder | Platform reliability + user journeys | UE5, Python**

### Option B (more senior, less “aspiring”)
**Product-minded Technical Lead | Platform reliability + user journeys | Ex-Ubisoft/Tencent | Building public-good prototypes (findit, SpendWhat)**

### Option C (explicit Pair keywords)
**Product Builder | Consumer-grade journeys + platform ops | Reliability, tooling, stakeholder alignment | GovTech/OGP focus**

Notes:
- Pair roles are allergic to vague. Put **journeys + platform** keywords early.
- Keep it mobile readable: first ~60 chars matter most.

## 2) New “About” (OGP Pair optimized)

Paste this as your new About (edit lightly for voice):

> I build reliable user journeys by turning messy reality into simple, shippable systems.
>
> I’ve spent my career as a technical animation lead on AAA products (Ubisoft, Tencent/TiMi), sitting at the intersection of design, engineering, and production. The through-line is product work: translating ambiguous requirements into roadmaps, building tools and workflows that unlock teams, and shipping systems that perform under real constraints.
>
> I’m now focused on transitioning into Product Management (Open Government Products), especially roles like Senior Product Manager (Pair) where the job is equal parts platform stewardship and consumer-grade experience. I’m building and shipping public-good prototypes (e.g., **findit**, **SpendWhat**) to demonstrate end-to-end PM craft.
>
> Strengths: stakeholder alignment, platform reliability, workflow design, rapid prototyping, and “reduce friction for users” thinking.
>
> Portfolio:
> - findit (mobile-first nearby toilets): https://mandlcho.github.io/findit/
> - GitHub: https://github.com/mandlcho

What this fixes vs current About:
- shifts from “creative-technical gap” to **user outcomes + platform**
- makes the PM goal explicit but grounded with proof

## 3) Experience rewrites (PM/outcomes language)

Rule of thumb:
- replace tool nouns with outcome verbs
- include who you partnered with (design/eng/prod)
- include impact (latency, iteration speed, quality, adoption, incidents, turnaround time)

### TiMi Studio Group — Senior Technical Animator (Jan 2025–Present)
Rewrite bullets like:
- Led delivery of gameplay realisation systems for a live AAA pipeline, partnering with design + engineering to translate feature intent into shippable behavior systems.
- Built and maintained tooling/workflows that reduced animator iteration time and lowered integration risk across teams.
- Improved system reliability via debouncing/caching/rate-limit style safeguards and clearer failure modes (apply similar framing to your actual work).

### Tencent (Lightspeed) — Senior Technical Animator (Sep 2022–Jan 2025)
Rewrite bullets like:
- Owned a cross-functional slice of gameplay feature delivery (design → implementation → validation), ensuring predictable behavior across edge cases.
- Maintained state-machine logic and debugging workflows to reduce regressions and improve QA turnaround.
- Built DCC pipeline tools (MotionBuilder/Maya) to remove repetitive work, improving throughput for the animation team.

### Tencent (NExT) — Senior Technical Animator (Nov 2020–Sep 2022)
Rewrite bullets like:
- Coordinated shared tooling initiatives across multiple studios, aligning requirements and shipping reusable tools (Python/Qt) that standardized workflows.
- Prototyped procedural animation approaches in Unreal, validating feasibility and iterating with engineering.
- Built NPC/AI behavior animation systems with clear interfaces for design + gameplay programming.

### Ubisoft Singapore — Assistant Technical Director / Technical Animator (2018–2020)
Rewrite bullets like:
- Served as point-of-contact between animation, design, and gameplay programming; drove alignment on scope, quality bar, and delivery milestones.
- Owned animation-related technical delivery for gameplay systems on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, balancing player experience with engine constraints.
- Created automation tooling to improve team productivity and reduce integration friction for new team members.

PM translation (what recruiters should read between the lines):
- roadmap ownership (within a domain)
- stakeholder management
- platform stewardship
- shipping under constraints

## 4) Featured section (replace showreels with PM artifacts)

Current featured items are showreels. For OGP PM, swap to:

1) **findit — fast nearby toilets (mobile-first)**
- Link: https://github.com/mandlcho/findit
- Live: https://mandlcho.github.io/findit/
- 1-liner: “Mobile-first public-good prototype. Works even without location permission. Reliability + trust UX improvements.”

2) **SpendWhat — Telegram bot for expense capture**
- Link: (repo)
- 1-liner: “Conversational capture → structured tracking. Built to reduce friction.”

3) **OGP teardowns repo (private)**
- Public-facing teaser if needed: “Product teardown practice focused on GovTech/OGP style roles.”

4) **Blueprint GPT / MotionKit / p4chimari** (only if they support the PM story)
- Frame as: “developer tooling / workflow automation / experimentation.”

---

## 5) Skills / keywords alignment (OGP Pair)

Add/feature these skills (not all at once, but make sure they appear):
- Product Management
- Product Strategy
- Roadmapping
- Stakeholder Management
- User Research (even if lightweight: interviews, synthesis)
- Metrics / KPI definition
- Experimentation / A/B testing (or “rapid iteration”)
- Platform / Systems thinking
- Reliability / Observability (incident mindset)
- Agile delivery

Keep some technical credibility:
- Python
- Unreal Engine
- Automation / Tooling

Also change Open To Work:
- Current: “Technical Director roles”
- Suggested: **Product Manager / Associate Product Manager / Product Owner / Technical Product Manager** (choose what’s available).

## 6) Optional: banner + 30-second summary

### Banner idea (simple)
Text only:
- “Building mobile-first public-good prototypes | PM portfolio in progress”
- URL: github.com/mandlcho

### 30-second verbal summary
“I’m a technical lead who’s spent years translating complex cross-functional requirements into shippable systems on AAA products. The skill I want to apply next is product: owning a user journey end-to-end, using platform reliability and workflow design to reduce friction. I’m building public-good prototypes like findit and SpendWhat to demonstrate PM craft while targeting OGP roles, especially Senior Product Manager (Pair).”

---

## Next actions (recommended order)
1) Update headline + About.
2) Replace Featured with findit + SpendWhat + 1–2 strongest proof pieces.
3) Update Open To Work roles.
4) Rewrite top 2 experiences with PM framing.
5) Pin 1 post: “PM portfolio + what I’m building (findit + SpendWhat).”
