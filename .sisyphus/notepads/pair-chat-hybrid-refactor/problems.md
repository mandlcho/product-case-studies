## Potential Blockers

### Potential Blocker 1: Slide Count Explosion
**Risk:** Splitting dense slides could result in 40+ slides (too many).
**Impact:** Presentation feels fragmented, loses narrative flow.
**Mitigation:** 
- Apply "One Breath Rule" as guideline, not absolute
- Keep related content together when narrative demands it
- Target: 30-35 slides max (including appendix)
**Status:** Monitoring during Task 2.1

### Potential Blocker 2: Visual Hierarchy Breaks Aesthetic
**Risk:** Large hero text (3-4em) might clash with monospace aesthetic.
**Impact:** Presentation loses cohesive design feel.
**Mitigation:**
- Test hero text sizes in context before full implementation
- Adjust if needed (2.5-3em might be sufficient)
- Maintain monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) for all sizes
**Status:** Will validate in Task 2.2

### Potential Blocker 3: Time Constraint
**Risk:** Estimated 7-10 hours might be underestimated.
**Impact:** Incomplete refactor or rushed execution.
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize Phase 1 (restructure) over Phase 2 (visual hierarchy)
- If time-constrained, complete restructure + top 5 worst slides only
- Can iterate on remaining visual hierarchy in future session
**Status:** Monitoring progress
