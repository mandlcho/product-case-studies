## What People Are Saying About RedeemSG and Parking.sg

Based on current community feedback and recent discussions, here's what Singaporeans are saying about these government apps:

### **RedeemSG: Security Concerns Dominate Recent Chatter**

The conversation around RedeemSG has shifted sharply toward security in early 2025. Following the January 3 CDC voucher disbursement, the Singapore Police Force issued multiple phishing advisories as scammers created fake RedeemSG websites to harvest personal information. Users received unsolicited SMS messages and Instagram posts directing them to counterfeit redemption pages where victims were asked to disclose banking credentials and personal details.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

Despite these security threats, the system itself generates impressive transaction volumes—140 million total transactions to date with \$1.97 billion in spending. The official user satisfaction score sits at 3.1/5. On the merchant side (for staff accepting vouchers), app ratings are solid: 4.2/5 on Android and 4.1/5 on iOS, though some users report technical issues like network errors on older phones and QR code scanning problems after iOS updates.[^6][^7]

The broader sentiment reflects pragmatism: Singaporeans appreciate the voucher system over cash payouts, viewing it as a way to channel spending toward legitimate businesses rather than allowing misuse. Many acknowledge government digital transformation efforts despite occasional hiccups.[^8]

### **Parking.sg: Highly Regarded, But Cracks Are Showing**

Parking.sg enjoys substantially warmer reception. It maintains a 4.1/5 rating on the iOS App Store and 3.6/5 on Google Play, with users consistently calling it "one of the better apps the government puts out."[^9][^10][^11]

**What users love:** The app eliminated paper coupons, offers per-minute billing (versus 30-minute coupon blocks), provides automatic refunds for early checkout, and enables remote parking extension through notifications. The user interface is praised as intuitive and following proper OS design guidelines. One user noted appreciation for its "practical features and intuitive UI which makes it easy for IT-savvy and not-so-savvy folks."[^12][^9]

**What's frustrating:** Recent events have exposed reliability gaps. On October 31, 2025, approximately 500 HDB carparks experienced a major system outage requiring manual barrier arm lifting. This followed a previous disruption on July 19, 2024, affecting 185 carparks during a global IT incident. Additionally, some users report the app occasionally fails to load charges for payment, and appeal rejections are strict even with evidence of technical errors. Users also request stronger expiry notifications (current alerts lack sound/vibration) and a "favorites" feature for frequently-used carparks.[^10][^13][^14][^15]

### **The Underlying Sentiment**

Both apps are viewed as part of Singapore's broader Smart Nation initiative, with genuine appreciation for the Open Government Products team behind them. However, there's a clear pattern: users accept imperfection in exchange for convenience and innovation, but their patience wears thin with reliability issues—particularly phishing risks for RedeemSG and system outages for Parking.sg. The general tone is "this is genuinely useful, but there's room to improve," rather than dismissive criticism.
