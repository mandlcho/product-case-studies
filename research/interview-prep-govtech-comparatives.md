## 3. Precedents for "Stripe for Government Vouchers" Positioning

### Direct Tech Infrastructure Precedents:

| Platform | Model | Consumer Visibility | Success Metric | Key Insight |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Singpass** | Infrastructure | Low (invisible to most users) | 99.9% uptime | Trusted by government, not app |
| **LifeSG** | Infrastructure | Low (embedded in app) | Service availability | Users don't "love" it, they rely on it |
| **PayNow (SG)** | Infrastructure | Low (backend for merchants) | Transaction success | Invisible to consumers |

### Key Pattern:
**Infrastructure = Reliability > Delight**

- **Infrastructure positioning:** Success = uptime, transaction success, availability
- **Consumer product positioning:** Success = NPS, satisfaction, delight
- **RedeemSG current problem:** Positioned as consumer product → measured by NPS (3.1/5) → feels like failure
- **RedeemSG proposed solution:** Reposition as infrastructure → measured by transaction success rate

**Interview Talking Point:**
> "RedeemSG's $1.97B in processed transactions shows the infrastructure works perfectly. But we're measuring consumer satisfaction like it's a consumer app. What if we reposition it as policy delivery infrastructure—measuring uptime instead of NPS, like how Singpass works?"

---

## 4. Questions to Prepare For

### Organizational Design:
1. "Does OGP's distributed model create coordination challenges vs. centralised agencies like Denmark DIGST?"
2. "How do we ensure cross-product learning across 40+ products?"

### Product Strategy:
1. "How do we prioritize which products get investment vs. sunsetting?"
2. "What's our framework for evaluating new product opportunities (e.g., digital vouchers vs. existing FormSG, Plumber)?"

### Citizen Trust:
1. "How do we measure digital literacy impact vs. Denmark's mandatory adoption model?"
2. "What role does public sentiment play in product decisions?"

### AI & Innovation:
1. "How should OGP balance AI innovation speed with governance guardrails (South Korea model)?"
2. "What lessons can we learn from Estonia's blockchain infrastructure approach?"

### Digital Inclusion:
1. "How does OGP identify accessibility gaps without public feedback loops like Denmark's strategy mandates?"

---

## 5. Interview Narratives Ready

### Narrative Option 1: "Agility through Diversity"
> "Our 40-product portfolio creates faster learning cycles than centralised agencies. When FormSG learns something, Plumber improves. When Singpass detects a fraud pattern, RedeemSG gets notified. This ecosystem intelligence isn't possible in single-agency models like Denmark DIGST."

### Narrative Option 2: "Trust Through Infrastructure"
> "The 'Stripe for Government Vouchers' positioning is powerful. Look at Singpass—it's infrastructure, nobody 'loves' it, but it has 99.9% uptime. LifeSG is embedded in the app, users don't think about it. RedeemSG is positioned as a consumer app with 3.1/5 rating. What if we reposition it as infrastructure—measuring transaction success rate instead of NPS?"

### Narrative Option 3: "Governance Through Transparency"
> "UK GDS publishes algorithmic records for every automated decision. South Korea conducts quarterly AI Security Surveys. Estonia has 61 IAC centers building global knowledge. What's OGP's equivalent for algorithmic transparency in our AI products?"
